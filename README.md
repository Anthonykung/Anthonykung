# Hello üëã

I'm Anthony Kung, an Electrical & Computer Engineer and also a Computer Scientist. I started coding at the age of 12 and have been working as a professional developer since the age of 13. From 2014 to 2020, I have worked on over 300 projects as a freelance developer including some multimillion companies, that's an average of 1 project per week.

I can be found on LinkedIn at [linkedin.com/in/anthonykung](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anthonykung/), feel free to chat with me! I love making friends :3c

In 2020, I helped developed the current web UI and a computer science curriculum for KidSpirit, the Oregon State University Youth Program, [check it out here](https://kidspirit.oregonstate.edu/).

In 2021, I won the Electrical and Computer Engineering Junior Design **Technical Choice Award** at Oregon State University with a Raspberry Pi Zero powered smart pet door [check it out here](https://eecs.engineering.oregonstate.edu/project-showcase/projects/?id=dKm379WTXGO5Dp0O).

In 2022, as part of senior capstone project, our team worked with Collins Aerospace to create a drone flight data recorder using Nvidia Jetson AGX Xavier, FLIR USB-C camera, Imperx GigE camera, and our own embedded control system, [check it out here](https://eecs.engineering.oregonstate.edu/project-showcase/projects/?id=SDiqTRFTNXFvWkLQ).

In 2023, I founded the Orange Airsoft Club at Oregon State University with over 25 active members of mostly engineering students, powered by the most innovative online system created with Next.js 14, [check it out here](https://orangeairsoft.com).

In 2024, I worked as a Software Engineering Intern at Intel Corporation on the Intel Query Processing Library Team, where I contributed to the development of the open source library that interface with In-Memory Analytics Accelerators found on 4th Gen and later Intel Xeon Scalable Processors.

In 2025, I helped develop the course CS/ECE/AI 499/599 Special Topics: HLS For AI Accelerators at Oregon State University, where I taught students how to use High-Level Synthesis (HLS) to design hardware accelerators for AI applications.

## üì¢ Shoutout

## ‚Ñπ FAQ

### üìü Forums

I'm not really active on forums, there's really no reason for me to so I only get on it when I'm bored, if someone needs my attention they could mention me. I only have a ~85k per day impact on Stack Overflow, I mean sure I have a Shopify Partner's badge on Shopify Community but that's a lot of people asking for free work. Ever since I helped a few people to fix their stuff cause I'm bored, I've been getting messages asking if I can fix their's, that's not cool.

### üë®‚Äçüè´ Tutorials

Yes, I do make free tutorials and stuff too with 1,632 enrollments, but I've put them on hold for now. Why? Take a look at this:

![Almost 500 notifications per day](https://vault.hailiga.org/Anthonykung/Images/Repl-it-Dashboard.PNG)

I assume you know the reason now. That's a lot of notifications. Don't know about you but that's a lot for a ~~teenager~~ ~~college kid~~ graduate school kid to handle.

But don't worry, the tutorials will be back sometime in the future when I have the resources to handle all that... Might take a few million years but they will be back...  eventually...

### üé• Videos

So I have made all my videos from old times private now because I sound so weird talking to a camera. They will be back as soon as I learn how to not sound funny on videos... maybe I can have an actual person to talk to like an interview that should sound more natural.

But if you have any ideas on what videos I should make or any kinds of ideas at all, send them here: [ideas@anth.dev](mailto:ideas@anth.dev) (I'm setting up a site for it, but for now we'll just stick to the email)

## üí¨ Ask me about

Anything! I'd love to chat about almost anything and I like to make friends. So you can [ask about my secrets](https://tellonym.me/anthonykung) and I may or may not tell you üòú.

## üì´ How to reach me:

1. Find me on Discord
2. Email me at [hi@anth.dev](mailto:hi@anth.dev)
3. Go on to my website using one of the following links:

  - [Anth.dev](https://anth.dev)
  - [Anthonian.dev](https://anthonian.dev)
  - [Anthos.link](https://anthos.link)

They all redirects to AnthonyKung.com eventually, so you might as well just go there...

4. Go on Trove and find Anthonykung or join Monster Buster Club MBC
5. Join me on Minecraft VR Compatible Java 1.19.2 [mcvr.anth.dev](https://mcvr.anth.dev)

He/They

## ‚ö° Fun fact:

- I was born in Taiwan but raised in 4 different countries and have never stayed for more than 6 months in my home country
- I'm a ~~teenager~~ graduate student that has been making everyone to believe I'm ~~20+~~ 16
- I watch cartoons, my backgrounds & blankets are Ben 10, Minecraft, Boruto...
- I'm almost NREMT licensed medic, the pandemic has gotten in the way of my rotations
- I behave like a kid but I don't consider myself a kid (I'm wearing the same shorts I wore when I was 10)
- I love Ubuntu, don't yell at me
- I love Starbucks and you can probably bribe me with it üòè
