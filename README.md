# Hello 👋

I'm Anthony Kung, an Electrical & Computer Engineer and also a Computer Scientist. I started coding at the age of 12 and have been working as a professional developer since the age of 13. I'm AWS partnered, GCP partnered, Azure partnered, IONOS partnered, Shopify partnered, BigCommerce partnered, GoDaddy Pro, and a whole lot more. Since 2014 I have worked on over 300 projects including some multimillion companies, that's an average of 1 project per week.

I currently operate 7 server networks and over 30 domains.

I'm currently looking for internship, if you have an opening for ITOps engineers or DevOps engineers, I'd love to get in touch!

I've been working full time so all projects are on hold for now...

Top secret projects that you'll know in a few seconds (or not)

### 👆 Looking For The "Add me as a partner so we can develop together" Button?

Join the Discord and introduce yourself 😉: https://discord.gg/TmVRSx6 No ads please, it's just a place to hang out and have fun

## 💬 Ask me about

Anything! I'd love to chat about almost anything and I like to make friends. So you can ask about my secrets and I may or may not tell you.

### ℹ FAQ

#### 📟 Forums

I'm not really active on forums, there's really no reason for me to so I only get on it when I'm bored, if someone needs my attention they could mention me. I only have a 38k per day impact on Stack overflow, I mean sure I have a Shopify Partner's badge on Shopify Community but that's a lot of people asking for free work. Ever since I helped someone fixed their stuff cause I'm bored, I've been getting messages asking if I can fix their's, that's not cool.

#### 👨‍🏫 Tutorials

Yes, I do make free tutorials and stuff too, but I've put them on hold for now. Why? Take a look at this:

![Almost 500 notifications per day](https://vault.hailiga.org/Anthonykung/Images/Repl-it-Dashboard.PNG)

I assume you know the reason now. That's a lot of notification for a day. Don't know about you but that's a lot for a teenager to handle.

But don't worry, the tutorials will be back sometime in the future when I have the resources to handle all that... Might take a few million years but they will be back eventually...

#### 🎥 Videos

So I have made all my videos from old times private now because I sound so weird talking to a camera. They will be back as soon as I learn how to not sound funny on videos... maybe I can have an actual person to talk to like an interview that should sound more natural.

But if you have any ideas on what videos I should make or any kinds of ideas at all, send them here: [ideas@anth.dev](mailto:ideas@anth.dev) (I'm setting up a site for it, but for now we'll just stick to the email)
