# Hello 👋

I'm Anthony Kung, an Electrical & Computer Engineer and also a Computer Scientist. I started coding at the age of 12 and have been working as a professional developer since the age of 13. From 2014 to 2020, I have worked on over 300 projects as a freelance developer including some multimillion companies, that's an average of 1 project per week.

I can be found on LinkedIn at [https://www.linkedin.com/in/anthonykung/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anthonykung/), feel free to chat with me! I love making friends :3c

In 2020, I helped developed the current web UI and a computer science curriculum for KidSpirit, the Oregon State University Youth Program, [check it out here](https://kidspirit.oregonstate.edu/).

In 2021, I won the Electrical and Computer Engineering Junior Design **Technical Choice Award** at Oregon State University with a Raspberry Pi Zero powered smart pet door [check it out here](https://eecs.engineering.oregonstate.edu/project-showcase/projects/?id=dKm379WTXGO5Dp0O).

In 2022, as part of senior capstone project, our team worked with Collins Aerospace to create a drone flight data recorder using Nvidia Jetson AGX Xavier, FLIR USB-C camera, Imperx GigE camera, and our own embedded control system, [check it out here](https://eecs.engineering.oregonstate.edu/project-showcase/projects/?id=SDiqTRFTNXFvWkLQ).

In 2023, I founded the Orange Airsoft Club at Oregon State University with over 25 active members of mostly engineering students, powered by the most innovative online system created with Next.js 14, [check it out here](https://orangeairsoft.com).

## ℹ FAQ

### 📟 Forums

I'm not really active on forums, there's really no reason for me to so I only get on it when I'm bored, if someone needs my attention they could mention me. I only have a ~85k per day impact on Stack Overflow, I mean sure I have a Shopify Partner's badge on Shopify Community but that's a lot of people asking for free work. Ever since I helped a few people to fix their stuff cause I'm bored, I've been getting messages asking if I can fix their's, that's not cool.

### 👨‍🏫 Tutorials

Yes, I do make free tutorials and stuff too with 1,632 enrollments, but I've put them on hold for now. Why? Take a look at this:

![Almost 500 notifications per day](https://vault.hailiga.org/Anthonykung/Images/Repl-it-Dashboard.PNG)

I assume you know the reason now. That's a lot of notifications. Don't know about you but that's a lot for a ~~teenager~~ ~~college kid~~ graduate school kid to handle.

But don't worry, the tutorials will be back sometime in the future when I have the resources to handle all that... Might take a few million years but they will be back...  eventually...

### 🎥 Videos

So I have made all my videos from old times private now because I sound so weird talking to a camera. They will be back as soon as I learn how to not sound funny on videos... maybe I can have an actual person to talk to like an interview that should sound more natural.

But if you have any ideas on what videos I should make or any kinds of ideas at all, send them here: [ideas@anth.dev](mailto:ideas@anth.dev) (I'm setting up a site for it, but for now we'll just stick to the email)

## 💬 Ask me about

Anything! I'd love to chat about almost anything and I like to make friends. So you can [ask about my secrets](https://tellonym.me/anthonykung) and I may or may not tell you 😜.

He/They

## ⚡ Fun fact:

- I was born in Taiwan but raised in 4 different countries and have never stayed for more than 6 months in my home country
- I'm a ~~teenager~~ graduate student that has been making everyone to believe I'm ~~20+~~ 16
- I watch cartoons, my backgrounds & blankets are Ben 10, Minecraft, Boruto...
- I'm almost NREMT licensed medic, the pandemic has gotten in the way of my rotations
- I behave like a kid but I don't consider myself a kid (I'm wearing the same shorts I wore when I was 10)
- I love Ubuntu, don't yell at me
- I love Starbucks and you can probably bribe me with it 😏
